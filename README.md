# Stock Performance Analysis Using Excel

## Project Overview
This project analyzes approximately five years of historical daily stock market data using Microsoft Excel.  
The objective was to develop foundational business analytics skills by working with real financial data, calculating returns, and visualizing long-term performance trends.

Stocks analyzed:
- **SPY** – S&P 500 ETF (market benchmark)
- **AAPL** – Apple Inc.
- **MSFT** – Microsoft Corporation
- **JPM** – JPMorgan Chase & Co.

## Methodology
The analysis followed these steps:

1. Organized daily closing prices for each stock
2. Calculated **daily returns** using percentage change
3. Computed **cumulative returns** to measure long-term growth
4. Calculated summary statistics including:
   - Average daily return
   - Volatility (standard deviation of daily returns)
5. Visualized cumulative performance using Excel line charts

All calculations were performed manually using Excel formulas.
