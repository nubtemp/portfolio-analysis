The objective was to develop foundational business analytics skills by working with real financial data, calculating returns, and visualizing long-term performance trends.

Stocks analyzed:
- **SPY** – S&P 500 ETF (market benchmark)
- **AAPL** – Apple Inc.
- **MSFT** – Microsoft Corporation
- **JPM** – JPMorgan Chase & Co.

## Methodology
The analysis followed these steps:

1. Organized daily closing prices for each stock
2. Calculated **daily returns** using percentage change
3. Computed **cumulative returns** to measure long-term growth
4. Calculated summary statistics including:
   - Average daily return
   - Volatility (standard deviation of daily returns)
5. Visualized cumulative performance using Excel line charts

All calculations were performed manually using Excel formulas.
