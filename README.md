# Stock Portfolio Performance Analysis (Excel)

## Overview
This project analyzes 5 years of daily stock market data for:
- SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
- AAPL
- MSFT
- JPM

The goal was to learn Excel, financial analysis, and data visualization from scratch.

## What I Did
- Collected historical daily price data
- Calculated daily returns
- Calculated cumulative returns
- Visualized stock performance over time
- Simulated a $1,000 equally weighted portfolio
- Compared individual stocks vs portfolio growth

## Key Insights
- Tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT) showed higher volatility and higher long-term returns
- SPY provided stable benchmark performance
- Diversification reduced downside risk compared to individual stocks

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel
- GitHub

## Files
- `Portfolio_Analysis.xlsx` – full dataset, calculations, and charts
- `/charts` – exported visuals

## Future Improvements
- Risk metrics (volatility, Sharpe ratio)
- Different portfolio weightings
- Automation using Python
